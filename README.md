# Poke Snap Mobile Platform

The Poke Snap Mobile Platform is a cross-platform mobile app built with React Native. At its core, the app has two duties:
- Take a **Snap**
- Send a **Poke**  

The client interacts with the Face Recognition Service, Poke Service, and Update Service as needed. It is responsible for adding new users to the back-end servers which includes adding new faces, sending location data, and poke requests.
